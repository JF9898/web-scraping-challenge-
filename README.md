# web-scraping-challenge-
using beautiful soup to read mars data


In the documents, there is a script to read the contents of each webpage.

part 2 of this webscraping challenge takes the table given and creates data visualizations regarding each topic... Mars is cold! also 1 year on mars = 2 years on earth. Take a look through each file and let me know if you disagree! 

You will notice that i took it upon myself to change the bar charts that were asked of us and conerted them to line charts which, to me were much easier to comprehend. There will be both at your disposal for you to judge for yourself!
